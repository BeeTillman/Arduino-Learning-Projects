## Projects

1. **LED Blink:** Introduction to the basic structure of an Arduino sketch with a simple LED blink.
2. **Button Control:** Learn how to use a push button to control an LED.
3. **Analog Input:** Explore analog input using a potentiometer to control the brightness of an LED.
4. **Ultrasonic Sensor:** Use an ultrasonic sensor to measure distance and control an LED based on proximity.
5. **Temperature and Humidity Sensor:** Integrate a DHT11 sensor to monitor temperature and humidity.
6. **Servo Motor Control:** Control a servo motor's position using potentiometer input.
7. **LCD Display:** Connect and use an LCD display to show information from sensors.

### Hardware

To run these projects, you will need:

- An Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Nano, etc.)
- USB cable for connecting Arduino to your computer
- LEDs, resistors, push buttons, sensors, and other electronic components as required by specific projects
